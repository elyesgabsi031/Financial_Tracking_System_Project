# Financial_Tracking_System_Project

**Overview**

The Financial Tracking App is a cool tool designed to help me manage personal finances with ease. It provides a comprehensive dashboard in Looker Studio that pulls real-time data from Google Sheets, offering a clear view of my financial health. The dashboard includes detailed insights into income, expenses, current balance, savings, and categorization of expenses.
